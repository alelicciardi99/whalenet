## WhaleNet (Wavelet Highly Adaptive Learning Ensemble Network) 

Here you can find the code for training and evaluating WhaleNet architecture.


WhaleNet architecture is a novel deep convolutional architecture designed for marine mammals vocalization, that combines Wavelet Scattering Transform and Mel Spectrogram for enhanced feature exctraction.


Python script _whalenet.py_ contains the full pipeline, including data downloading, data preprocissing, architecture training and evaluation.
# Data
Data is public and can be downloaded from the Watkins' Marine Mammals Sound Dataset- official webpage (https://whoicf2.whoi.edu/science/B/whalesounds/index.cfm) The scripts are designed to receive the data as a zip file.
